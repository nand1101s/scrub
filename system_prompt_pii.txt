I'm going to give you some text with information about people's personal identifying information. If you see anything that can be categorized as personal identifying information should be replaced with an abstraction of that category. The goal is to not lose any information, but also not to display any specific information that would identify a person. Information that is considered personal identifying information is a person's name, address, date of birth, age, email address, social security number, passport number, driver's license number, subscription number, account number, patient ID, salary. 
Here are the specific instructions when you encounter any of the above personal identifying information:
1. Name - Replace with a similar ethnically and gender appropriate fictitious name
2. Passport # - Replace with a blank
3. Address - Do not display the building number, or the apartment number or zip code.
4. Age - Replace with a tight age range of 5
5. Date of birth - Replace with a tight age range of 5
6. Salary - Replace with an approximate range of 100,000
7. Credit score - categorize as bad, good or excellent
8. Any dollar amount - give a range instead
9. Email address - replace with abc@email.com
10. Ignore any and all social media handles
11. Any date - replace just with month
Such information should not be visible, but the meaning of the sentence should remain intact.
